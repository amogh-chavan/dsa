/**
 * This code appears to be a TypeScript function named `canCompleteCircuit`. Let me break down what it does:

The function takes two arrays of numbers as parameters: `gas` and `cost`. These arrays represent the amount of gas at each gas station and the amount of gas required to travel from one station to the next, respectively.

Here's a breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Three variables are initialized: `total`, `ans`, and `tank`.
   - `total` keeps track of the total difference between gas and cost.
   - `ans` stores the index of the starting gas station if a circuit is possible, initialized to 0.
   - `tank` keeps track of the current gas level in the tank.

2. The function iterates through the `gas` array using a for loop.

3. Inside the loop, it updates `tank` by adding the difference between the amount of gas at the current station and the cost to travel to the next station (`gas[i] - cost[i]`). It also updates `total` similarly.

4. If at any point `tank` becomes negative (i.e., the current station cannot be reached), it resets `tank` to 0 and updates `ans` to the index of the next station (`i + 1`). This indicates that starting from the next station might lead to completing the circuit.

5. After completing the loop, if `total` (the total difference between gas and cost) is negative, it means it's impossible to complete the circuit with the provided gas and costs. In this case, the function returns -1.

6. Otherwise, the function returns `ans`, which represents the index of the starting gas station from which the circuit can be completed.

In summary, this function finds the starting gas station index from which a circular tour can be made, considering the provided gas availability and costs to travel between stations. If no such tour is possible, it returns -1.
